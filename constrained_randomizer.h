/*This function takes a budget, an array of strictly positive costs, and a random number generator, and generates an unbiased 
  random selection from among the valid arrangements of items (with validity defined as in the unbounded knapsack problem; in 
  particular, any item can occur multiple times).  The results are output to the output argument, which should have the same  
  size as the costs argument.*/

/*T should be an integral type or a class that represents an integer (in particular, it should behave normally under arithmetic 
  operations, and there should be no valid values between x and x+1).  less<T> and divides<T> should be defined, with the usual

  If half_open_dist is false, the distribution parameter should have an interface similar to the uniform_int_distribution class: 
  It should be constructed with closed lower and upper bounds as arguments, and called with no arguments.  If half_open_RNG is 
  true, the lower bound should be closed, and the upper bound open.  In either case, distribution should be callable with
  an argument of type URNG, yielding a result of type T (or a type implicitly convertible to it).*/

/*Mathematical note: If a collection of n distinct uniformly random integer values in [1,m+n] are sorted, the differences 
  between adjacent values will constitute an unbiased ordered selection of positive integers adding up to at most 
  m+n; subtracting 1 from each difference therefore results in non-negative integers adding up to at most m.
  
  m is set higher than the given budget due to truncation when dividing each value by the cost; a trial-and-error
  approach is then used to eliminate solutions that exceed the actual budget.  Each potential output derives from a set of
  Prod differences between adjacent values, where Prod is the product of all the costs.*/
