# Constrained-Randomizer
The Constrained Randomizer function takes a budget and an array of costs for various items, and uniformly randomly selects a number of each item such that the total remains under budget.  (The constraint is thus the same as in the unbounded knapsack problem, but rather than optimizing the task is to randomly select a within-constraint solution such that every such solution has equal probability.)
